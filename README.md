# ao-scan-bot
This Python project will run a Selenium script which loops through AO Scan SEFI custom playlist, homeopathics, and AO Tune.  The script can loop through multiple users and the playlist is customizable.

## .env file
A file named .env needs to be created in this directory containing valid credentials to AO Scan.  Below is an example of the .env file.<br>

```
AO_USERNAME=ao-user@email.com
AO_PASSWORD=PasSw@rD!
```
